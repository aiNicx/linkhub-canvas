# Built-in Tools

Compound systems come equipped with a comprehensive set of built-in tools that can be intelligently called to answer user queries. These tools not only expand the capabilities of language models by providing access to real-time information, computational power, and interactive environments, but also eliminate the need to build and maintain the underlying infrastructure for these tools yourself.

Built-in tools with Compound systems are not HIPAA Covered Cloud Services under Groq's Business Associate Addendum at this time. These tools are also not available currently for use with regional / sovereign endpoints.

## [Default Tools](#default-tools)

The tools enabled by default vary depending on your Compound system version:

| Version                        | [Web Search](https://console.groq.com/docs/web-search) | [Code Execution](https://console.groq.com/docs/code-execution) | [Visit Website](https://console.groq.com/docs/visit-website) |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Newer than 2025-07-23 (Latest) | ✅                              | ✅                                      | ✅                                    |
| 2025-07-23 (Default)           | ✅                              | ✅                                      | ❌                                    |

All tools are automatically enabled by default. Compound systems intelligently decide when to use each tool based on the user's query.

Jump to the [Configuring Tools](#configuring-tools) section to learn how to enable specific tools via their identifiers. Some tools are only available on certain Compound system versions - [learn more about how to set your Compound version here](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound#system-versioning).

## [Configuring Tools](#configuring-tools)

You can customize which tools are available to Compound systems using the `compound_custom.tools.enabled_tools` parameter. This allows you to restrict or specify exactly which tools should be available for a particular request.

  
For a list of available tool identifiers, see the [Available Tools](#available-tools) section.
